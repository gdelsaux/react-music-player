# VIBES PLAYER


## Tech stack

- ```React.js```
- ```Sass```

## Description

This is a music player with responsive design built with React.js. 

I did not want to use any global state management tools such as ```Redux``` for this project hence why most states are lifted up to ```App.js``` so they could be passed down as ```props```

Users are able to select a song from a library and all functionability of a music player can be expected:

- Skip to next track
- Skip to previous track
- Pause/Play
- auto play the next track at the end of a song

Some animations can be noticed on desktop when the user click on the music library button.

This are the views from desktop and mobile:
